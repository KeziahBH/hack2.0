        <h2>HTML BASICS</h2>
        <p>HTML Basics contains all the basic HTML examples. HTML is the basic language for web content creation. It is used to create a structure or blueprint of the web documents.
            HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used to create web pages. HTML is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between web pages. A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag to define the structure of web pages.

This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) are human-readable. The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text.
        </p>
        <h2>HTML Elements and Tags</h2>
        <p>HTML uses predefined tags and elements that tell the browser how to display the content. HTML elements include an opening tag, some content, and a closing tag.

            Remember to include closing tags. If omitted, the browser applies the effect of the opening tag until the end of the page.</p>
            <h2>HTML Page Structure</h2>
            <p>The basic structure of an HTML page is shown below. It contains the essential building-block elements (i.e. doctype declaration, HTML, head, title, and body elements) upon which all web pages are created.<br> !DOCTYPE html -- This is the document type declaration (not technically a tag). It declares a document as being an HTML document. The doctype declaration is not case-sensitive.<br>html --  This is called the HTML root element. All other elements are contained within it.</p>
            <h2>HTML Headings</h2>
            <p>HTML heading tags play an essential role. They not only organize information but also impact search engine rankings. In this article, weâ€™ll learn about the significance of heading tags, their hierarchy, and best practices for optimizing them. The HTML heading tag is used to define the headings of a page.

                HTML provides six levels of heading elements, ranging from highest to lowest</p>
